zoosync \- Service Discovery tool using Zookeeper


.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBzoosync\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fICOMMANDS\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION

Help usage message.

.TP
\fB-a\fR, \fP--acl\fR \fIACL\fR
Additional ACL set for each service node, separated by commas. Default is \fIworld:anyone:r\fR.

When using separated permissions, there should be also the shared admin ACL, for example:

.RE
.ni

.TP
\fB-b\fR, \fP--base\fR \fIBASE_DIRECTORY\fR
Base zookeeper directory. Default is \fI/indigo-testbed\fR.

.TP
\fB-H\fR, \fB--hostname\fR \fIHOSTNAME\fR
Use specified hostname instead of the system one.

.TP
\fB-m\fR, \fB--multi\fR \fIMODE\fR
How to treat multiple hostnames in output. It can be \fBfirst\fR, \fBlist\fR, \fBrandom\fR. Default is \fBfirst\fR.

.TP
\fB-n\fR, \fP--dry\fR
Do not perform any changes, only read-only network operations.

.TP
\fB-u\fR, \fP--user\fR
User name for autentization to Zookeeper service. Default is \fIindigo-testbed\fR.

.TP
\fB-p\fR, \fP--password\fR
Password for autentization to Zookeeper service. Default if \fIchangeit\fR.

.TP
\fB-s\fR, \fP--services\fR \fISERVICE\fR...
Comma separated list of services.

.TP
\fB-w\fR, \fP--wait\fR \fITIME\fR
Time to wait in seconds for \fBwait\fR command. Zero mean wait infinitely. Default is 1800.

.TP
\fB-z\fR, \fP--zookeeper\fR \fISERVER\fR...
Comma separated list of Zookeeper servers.


.SH COMMANDS

.TP
\fBcleanup\fR
Remove all inactive hostnames from services and get information about all requested services. The test of activity is performed by \fIping\fR and \fIping6\fR commands.

.TP
\fBcreate\fR
Create service endpoints. If any service/hostname combination is already created, error is returned.

.TP
\fBget\fR
Get information about all requested services.

.TP
\fBdeploy\fR
Configure \fBzoosync\fR on the local system:

 * installs startup script \fI/etc/init.d/zoosync\fR or unit file \fI/etc/systemd/system/zoosync.service\fR and enable \fBzoosync\fR service
 * creates config file \fI/etc/zoosyncrc\fR, if not exists already
 * creates default file \fI/etc/default\fR with services, if not exists already
 * creates daily cron job \fI/etc/cron.d/zoosync\fR

Install prefix can be specified using environment variable \fB$DESTDIR\fR.

Service is not enabled when \fB--dry\fR option is used.

.TP
\fBlist\fR
Get information about all services.

.TP
\fBpurge\fR
Purge requested services. It will remove all endpoints and service nodes.

.TP
\fBread-tag\fR \fITAGNAME\fR...
Read tags of service endpoints. Hostname option and list of services to select proper endpoints is needed.

.TP
\fBread-tags\fR
Read all tags of service endpoints. Hostname option to select proper endpoints is needed. Synonym for \fBtags\fR.

.TP
\fBregister\fR
Register service endpoints. If any service/hostname combination is already created, no error is returned.

.TP
\fBremove\fR
Remove service endpoints. If any service/hostname combination doesn't exist, error is returned.

.TP
\fBtag\fR \fITAGNAME\fR=\fIVALUE\fR...
Tag service endpoints. If \fITAGNAME\fR begins with '_' (underscore), the value is protected using more strict ACL.

.TP
\fBtags\fR
Read all tags of service endpoints. Hostname option to select proper endpoints is needed. Synonym for \fBread-tags\fR.

.TP
\fBunregister\fR
Unregister service endpoints. If any service/hostname combination doesn't exist, no error is returned.

.TP
\fBuntag\fR \fITAGNAME\fR...
Remove tag from service endpoints.

.TP
\fBwait\fR
Sit and wait, until all required services have an endpoint in Zookeeper.


.SH ENVIRONMENT

.TP
\fBZOOSYNC_CONF\fR
Location of the configuration file.


.SH FILES

.TP
\fB/etc/zoosyncrc\fR
Default location of a configuration file. All long options are available, see \fBOPTIONS\fR.


.SH EXAMPLES

.SS Cleanup and wait for services

This may be called on the side requiring given service.

.nf
 ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS='zoo1.example.com,zoo2.example.com,zoo3.example.com'
 MY_SERVICES='service,service2,service3'

 eval `zoosync --host ${ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS} --services ${MY_SERVICES} cleanup`
 
 echo "active: ${SERVICES}"
 echo "missing: {MISSING}"
 
 eval `zoosync --host ${ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS} --services ${MY_SERVICES} wait`
.fi

.SS Service provider start-up

.nf
 ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS='zoo1.example.com,zoo2.example.com,zoo3.example.com'
 zoosync --host ${ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS} --services service1 register
.fi

.SS Service provider shutdown

.nf
 ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS='zoo1.example.com,zoo2.example.com,zoo3.example.com'
 zoosync --host ${ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS} --services service1 unregister
.fi


.SH NOTES

.SS Configuration

The config file \fI/etc/zoosyncrc\fR can be used for list for Zookeper servers, credentials, and other options:

.nf
.RS
cat > /etc/zoosyncrc <<EOF
zookeeper=zoo1.example.com,zoo2.example.com,zoo3.example.com
user=indigo-testbed
password=changeit
services=service1,service2,service3
EOF
.RE
.fi

You may need to use system startup scripts on service providers to register and unregister services. See \fBdeploy\fR command.


.SS Hierarchical ACL

By default ACLs are created on the base directory by the first service provider client creating the base directory. It is expected all clients are configured with the same credentials.

It is possible to use separated credentials for particular services. In that case set \fBcdrw\fR permissions for all service providers and \fBcdrwa\fR permissions for the administrator identity. For example:

.nf
.RS
setAcl /indigo\-testbed digest:indigo\-testbed:84VCzhAPjyq3fmBce9rvc3qgme4=:cdrwa,world:anyone:r,user1:wz6UK/Kzj7hbM8lUA/zNat8T6/M=:cdrw,user2:xkNyJWRcR8+7ugcyJpCXtiQ41rs=:cdrw
.RE
.fi

Clients providing the same service must have the same credentials and all clients must have configured shared ACLs for easier cleanups (see \fB\-\-acl\fR in \fBOPTIONS\fR).
